This code is based on CodeBullet's YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmQ4Dqxs0HI&t=885s&ab_channel=CodeBullet)
You can see how the AI learns to play.
Run EvolutionaryAlgorithms.py to play

You can change the population by changing PUPOLATION_SIZE (default 100) in settings.py.

# Game Play
You can press 'Tab' to change mode (single mode and AI mode)
Press 'B' to see how the best player in population plays the game.
Press the up arrow button to increase evolution speed, and the down arrow button to slow down it.
In single mode, you can press 'N' to jump to the next level (It's cheating time) :))
